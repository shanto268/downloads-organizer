This is a script to organize the files in your downloads folder into subfolders like IMAGES, AUDIO, VIDEO, EBOOKS, etc. 

To use this script:
1. Make sure you are running Python version later than 3.5.
2. Clone this repository. 
3. ```cd downloads-organizer```
4. ```cd downloadsorganizer```
5. ```python main_script.py```

Note: This has only been tested on Mac OSX and assumes that the path to your downloads folder is "/Users/\<username>/Downloads/"

Feedback or suggestions welcome!
